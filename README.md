# Top-Down-RPG
Online Repo for Top Down Multiplayer RPG made in Unreal Engine 5 2.0

Game Concept:
INSERT NAME HERE is a multiplayer extraction game inspired by the playstyle of Dungeons & Dragons (D&D). In this game, players take on the roles of skilled adventurers seeking out powerful ancient relics hidden in a vast and mystical world. They must form parties, strategize, and overcome various challenges to successfully extract these valuable artefacts.

Setting:
The game is set in a high-fantasy realm filled with diverse landscapes, dangerous dungeons, enchanted forests, and ancient ruins. Each region is guarded by unique creatures and formidable guardians, making the extraction process a thrilling and perilous adventure.

Gameplay Mechanics:

Party Formation: Players can team up with their friends or join random groups to form parties of 2-4 adventurers. Each party member must select a unique character class with distinct abilities and strengths, such as warriors, mages, rogues, clerics, and rangers.

Relic Quests: The game offers a wide array of relic quests with varying difficulty levels and storylines. Each quest revolves around the extraction of a specific relic hidden in a different part of the world. Some relics might require multiple quest stages to acquire fully.

Exploration and Discovery: Players explore the vast open world, unravelling clues, solving puzzles, and navigating treacherous terrains to find the locations of relics. Interaction with NPCs and careful observation of the environment is crucial to uncovering hidden paths and secrets.

Tactical Combat: When players encounter guardians, monsters, or rival adventuring parties during their quest, the game transitions into tactical combat mode. The combat system is turn-based, allowing players to strategize their moves, utilise unique abilities, and coordinate attacks with their party members.

Teamwork and Cooperation: To succeed in challenging quests, players must work together and utilise the strengths of their individual classes. Team synergy and communication are vital, as players can combine abilities to create powerful combo attacks.

Risk and Reward: Extracting relics is not without risks. Players must manage resources like health potions, mana, and stamina wisely, as well as decide whether to push onward or retreat to safety. The more challenging the quest, the greater the potential rewards in the form of valuable loot, experience points, and rare items.

Player Progression: As players complete quests and defeat powerful foes, they earn experience points to level up and unlock new skills and abilities. Customization of character builds allows players to tailor their strengths to their preferred playstyle.

Friendly Competition: While players can cooperate, the game also incorporates competitive elements. Limited relics and high-demand quests may lead to rivalries between parties, making the race for extraction more intense and exciting.

Guilds and Events: Players can join guilds for enhanced coordination, support, and social interaction. The game hosts special events, such as world bosses, special relic appearances, or competitive guild challenges, to keep the experience dynamic and engaging.

Conclusion:
INSERT NAME HERE blends the immersive world-building and role-playing aspects of Dungeons & Dragons with the excitement of cooperative and competitive multiplayer gameplay. The game promises an epic journey filled with discovery, danger, and the pursuit of legendary relics, providing a rich and memorable gaming experience for players who enjoy both D&D-style play and multiplayer challenges.
